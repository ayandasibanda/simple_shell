Simple Shell Project

The Simple Shell Project is a basic UNIX command line interpreter, implemented in C. The shell provides a command line interface that enables users to interact with the operating system by executing commands. The shell enables users to run other programs in an environment that offers features such as command history and handles environment variables, logical operators and aliases.
